# Enigma-Bombe
Creating an Enigma Machine and Bombe Machine

Will be using Python and creating a user interface for people to encrypt and decrypt messages as they would like

Enigma:
Required Parts - a plugboard(allows up to 10 letters to be swapped), 3 rotors(offset the alphabet), a reflector(the final step)
User input: Date of message(can be used to auto fill the variables from a database), 10 letter swaps, the 3 rotors(I - V), the reflector (A or B), and the message.

will show the encryption method
will show the decryption method - same as the encryption


Bombe:
So we're going with Hello World for now
